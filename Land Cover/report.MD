## Change in Land Cover Due to COVID-19 in parts of India.

Rapid urbanisation and population increase have had a significant influence on ecosystems in recent decades, increasing land degradation and 
decreasing human well-being. The conversion of a pervious  land surface into an impervious surface is one of the most widespread forms of 
land use/land cover change (LULCC). LULCC dramatically changes land-atmosphere interactions. 

The application of remote sensing are widely used. Several spectral indices have been used, such as the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), 
normalised difference built-up index (NDBI), normalised difference water index (NDWI), leaf area index (LAI), normalised difference soil index (NDSI), 
land surface temperature (LST) and/or using the combination of different indices. 

In this study, I used normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), to check the impact of COVID-19 on Land Use/Land Cover in parts of India.

## Study Area
Used three locations. 
- Hyderabad
- Gir National Park
- Sundarbans

## Data Source
In this study, the satellite images for the assessment were derived from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/).
Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) images were selected in 2019 and 2020 during the different phases of lockdown (pre lockdown and post lockdown).

## Results
The reason for three locations were because I couldn't get satisfactory results for the first two locations (Hyderabad, Gir National Park). And then, I used
the Sundarbans, which was used by one of the major references I got ideas from.

As you can see, there has been a slight change in Land Cover/Land Use for the good. 

## Limitations
The purpose of this study was to determine the environmental effect of the COVID-19 lockdown. This research looked at the effects of lockdown in 2020 and 2019 
during the identical lockdown phases. Thus, in future studies, the long-term impact of COVID-19 amid lockdown must be considered. And, a total of twelve satellite 
images (six for each year) from two phases of lockdown were used. These photos may not accurately depict the lockdown phases. As a result, more photos should be 
considered for a more thorough study.


## Conclusion
Urban environment areas in developing countries have increased rapidly in the past few decades. Human activities have increased negative environmental impacts.
In this context, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic provided us with a golden opportunity to identify the impact of human activities. The strict restrictions on 
human mobility, and the closure of industrial activities and other productive activities, resulted in a reduction in pressures on the environment. Thus, the lockdown 
due to COVID-19 improved environmental quality.
