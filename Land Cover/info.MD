### Change in Land Cover Due to COVID-19 in parts of India.

In recent decades, rapid urban expansion and population growth have dramatically impacted ecosystems, 
increasing land degradation and reducing human wellbeing. One of the most visible impacts of urban expansion 
is the reduction in green spaces(GS), which is well known to affect life quality. The conversion of a pervious 
land surface into an impervious surface is one of the most widespread forms of land use/land cover change (LULCC). 
LULCC dramatically changes land-atmosphere interactions. 

The application of remote sensing are widely used. Several spectral indices have been used, such as the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), 
normalised difference built-up index (NDBI), normalised difference water index (NDWI), leaf area index (LAI), normalised difference soil index (NDSI), 
land surface temperature (LST) and/or using the combination of different indices. 

In this, I used normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), to check the impact of COVID-19 on Land Use/Land Cover in parts of India.
