## Change in Land Cover Due to COVID-19 in parts of India.

In recent decades, rapid urban expansion and population growth have dramatically impacted ecosystems, 
increasing land degradation and reducing human wellbeing. One of the most visible impacts of urban expansion 
is the reduction in green spaces(GS), which is well known to affect life quality. The conversion of a pervious 
land surface into an impervious surface is one of the most widespread forms of land use/land cover change (LULCC). 
LULCC dramatically changes land-atmosphere interactions. 

The application of remote sensing are widely used. Several spectral indices have been used, such as the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), 
normalised difference built-up index (NDBI), normalised difference water index (NDWI), leaf area index (LAI), normalised difference soil index (NDSI), 
land surface temperature (LST) and/or using the combination of different indices. 

In this study, I used normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), to check the impact of COVID-19 on Land Use/Land Cover in parts of India.

## Study Area
Used three locations. 
- Hyderabad
- Gir National Park
- Sundarbans

## Data Source
In this study, the satellite images for the assessment were derived from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/).
Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) images were selected in 2019 and 2020 during the different phases of lockdown (pre lockdown and post lockdown).

## Results
The reason for three locations were because I couldn't get satisfactory results for the first two locations (Hyderabad, Gir National Park). And then, I used
the Sundarbans, which was used by one of the major references I got ideas from.

As you can see, there has been a slight change in Land Cover/Land Use for the good. 

## Limitations
This study attempted to understand the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the environment. This study assessed the impact of lockdown in 2020 and 2019 during the 
same periods of lockdown phases. Thus, in future studies, the long-term impact of COVID-19 amid lockdown must be considered. And, a total of twelve satellite images (six for each year) from two phases of lockdown were used. These images may not be representative of the lockdown phases. Therefore, more images should be taken into consideration
for a better analysis.

## Conclusion
Urban environment areas in developing countries have increased rapidly in the past few decades. Human activities have increased negative environmental impacts.
In this context, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic provided us with a golden opportunity to identify the impact of human activities. The strict restrictions on 
human mobility, and the closure of industrial activities and other productive activities, resulted in a reduction in pressures on the environment. Thus, the lockdown 
due to COVID-19 improved environmental quality.
