## Change in Land Cover Due to COVID-19 in parts of India.

In recent decades, rapid urban expansion and population growth have dramatically impacted ecosystems, 
increasing land degradation and reducing human wellbeing. One of the most visible impacts of urban expansion 
is the reduction in green spaces(GS), which is well known to affect life quality. The conversion of a pervious 
land surface into an impervious surface is one of the most widespread forms of land use/land cover change (LULCC). 
LULCC dramatically changes land-atmosphere interactions. 

The application of remote sensing are widely used. Several spectral indices have been used, such as the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), 
normalised difference built-up index (NDBI), normalised difference water index (NDWI), leaf area index (LAI), normalised difference soil index (NDSI), 
land surface temperature (LST) and/or using the combination of different indices. 

In this study, I used normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), to check the impact of COVID-19 on Land Use/Land Cover in parts of India.

## Study Area
Used three locations. 
- Hyderabad
- Gir National Park
- Sundarbans

## Data Source
In this study, the satellite images for the assessment were derived from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/).
Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) images were selected in 2019 and 2020 during the different phases of lockdown (pre lockdown and post lockdown).

## Results
The reason for three locations were because I couldn't get satisfactory results for the first two locations (Hyderabad, Gir National Park). And then, I used
the Sundarbans, which was used by one of the major references I got ideas from.
